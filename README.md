# viz
It would be so much fun to program, if we were able to "see" what our program is actually doing. Ever used print statements while debugging to see the state of your program? Well, no more.

## goals
- visualization of data structures (the easy part)
- visualization of algorithms (the hard part) 
- custom visualizations
- viz shouldn't get in your way.
- hot reloading
